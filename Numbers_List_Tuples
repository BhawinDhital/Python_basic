Numbers are being used to represent scores in games, data in visualization and so on.
Python treats numbers in different ways.
1. Integers:
You can add "+", subtract"-", multiply "*", and divide "/" integers in python.
for example:
You can add 2 and 3 where there are integers.
you an apply: 2+3 or 2*3 or 2+3*4 and so on.

2. Floats:
Any number with a decimal point is a float. For eg. 0.1
Version of python affects the results while working with integers. For example, Python 2 has a
little different result.
When you apply 3 / 2, the output is 1.
To avoid this error, you have to type 3.0 / 2, the output is then 1.5.
Or you can type 3 / 2.0 or 3.0 / 2.0 (see examples in p2.py files)

3. Lists and Tuples
A list in general stores a series of items in a particular order. List are mutable objects which means you can modify a list objects
after it has been created. However tuples are immutable objects. That means you can not modify a tuple objects after it has been
created.
In list, you can access items using an index, or within a loop.
for example, we make a list:
Friends = ['Hem', 'Thir', 'Bishnu']
First_friend=Friends[0]
print(First_friend)

In the above example, Friends is a list having three names as items in the list. It's index start from zero.
That's why Friends[0] assigned to 'Hem'.
Another example of list is:
Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
To get the first item in the list, use/type
First_item = Market[0]
print(First_item)

This gives the output 'Aldi'.

For the last item you can use
Last_item = Market[-1]
print(Last_item)

This gives 'Costco'.

Again, you can add 'title' as
Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
print(Market[0].title())
This also gives output 'Aldi'.
Further, you can combine string and list as:
Result = " My favorite market is" + " " + Market[0] + "."
print(Result)
This gives My favorite market is Aldi.

#Looping through a List
for shop in Market:
    print(shop)
This gives the result:
Aldi
Lidl
Costco

#Changing element in a List
Ok! what if you decided to change items in the List.
for example, you want to change first item Aldi by Food_Lion.
Then you can do this the following way.
#Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
#print(Market)
#Market[0]= 'Food_Lion'
#print(Market)
This replaces the first item by 'Food_Lion'.

#Adding elements to the given List.
Just use the append meaning add.
Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
Market.append('Fod_Lion')
print(Market)
This gives: ['Aldi', 'Lidl', 'Costco', 'Fod_Lion'].
You can assign the index to the inserting item as below.
#Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
#Market.insert(0,'Fod_Lion')
#print(Market)
This insert 'Food_Lion' at the First position, index 0.

#Removing an item from the List.
For this you have to use del(delete) command as:
#Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
#del Market[0]
#print(Market)
This deletes the first item and gives the result as:
['Lidl', 'Costco']

#Removing a n item using pop method.
#Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
#popped_Market = Market.pop()
#print(Market)
#print(popped_Market)
The results are:
['Aldi', 'Lidl']
Costco
It means popped command removes the last item in the List.
However, you can popped any item from the given list.
for this you have to give/define the corresponding index in the list.
For example:
Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
Shop = Market.pop(1)
print(Shop)
The output for print(Shop) is Lidl.
There is another command to remove the item in the list.
You can use 'remove' command as below.
#Market = ['Aldi','Lidl','Costco']
#Market.remove('Lidl')
#print(Market)
This removes 'Lidl' from the list.

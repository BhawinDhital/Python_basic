#Beginner's guide to python: All examples to run in python are written in p1.py file.
codes begin with # sign.

1. Variables and String:
Variables are used to store values. For example, if you write x = 5, then x is used as a variable to store the value 5.
A string is a series of character which in general surrounded by single or double quotes. Your name can be
considered as a string. Or,
say you live in Nepal, then your country name "Nepal" is a string.
There are different ways to represent the string.
i) just by a single quote == 'Nepal'
for example:
#country = 'Nepal'
#print(country)
#print ("Hello world")
So, you can define the string in many ways. You can also define a string with variables.
Same as above examples:
#say = "Hello world"
#print(say)
This printout Hello world. In this way you can create a string and assign it to a variable.
If you want to know the type: whether it is a string or variable, you can check it by the following way:
#print(type(say))
This gives <type'str'> which means "Hello world" is a string.
For example:
#x = 5
#print(type(x))
This gives <type,'int'> which means 5 is an integer values stored in x. Great!

Next thing is combining the strings.
"This is a string"
'This is also a string'
The word "combining strings" is called "Concatenation".
#First_name = 'Hem'
#Last_name = 'Dutt'
#Full_name = first_name +' ' Last_name
#print(Full_name)
 This is the way you can add two strings.

 #Finding an index of a substring in a string.
 You know that the string is made up of many characters, so for each characters in a series , you can determine the index of
 each characters as below:
 #"Nepal".index("p")
 #2
So in the above example, "Nepal" is a string and the index number starts from 0 so the index number for the letter "p" is 2.


There are several ways to deal with strings. You can play with case since the python codes are case sensitive.
for example:
name = "Hem Dutt" is a string. If you apply the following,
print(name.upper()) which gives all upper case.
print(name.lower()) which gives all lower case.

There are many ways you can plays with strings and variables.
